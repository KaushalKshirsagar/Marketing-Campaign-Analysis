# Why I used an Excel ?

In this project, I chose Excel as the primary technology due to its versatile capabilities in data analysis and visualization. Excel provides a user-friendly interface that facilitates efficient cleaning and handling of the dataset, making it an ideal tool for manipulating and preparing the data for analysis. Its extensive array of functions and formulas allowed me to address missing data and assign appropriate data types to each column seamlessly.

Excel's powerful Pivot Table feature played a crucial role in the analysis by offering the flexibility to create various pivot charts and graphs. This dynamic functionality allowed me to effortlessly pivot and aggregate the data, gaining deeper insights into customer behavior and campaign effectiveness. Additionally, Excel's robust charting and graphing features enabled the creation of visually appealing representations of the dataset, aiding in the exploration of key questions related to customer behavior.

Furthermore, Excel's flexibility in building dashboards allowed me to construct a comprehensive and interactive visualization tool for the analysis. The familiarity of Excel among users ensures that the generated insights can be easily shared and understood by a wider audience. By leveraging Excel in this project, I aimed to harness the power of its analytical and visualization capabilities, including the dynamic capabilities of Pivot Tables, to deliver a compelling and accessible analysis of the marketing campaign dataset, ultimately guiding strategic decisions for enhancing product purchases.
